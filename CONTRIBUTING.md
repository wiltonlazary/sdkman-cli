## Contributing

We greatly value the feedback and contributions of our users. We have a simple process in place to facilitate this:

### Bugs and New Features

We keep a distinction between New Features and Bugs/Issues. We try to minimise the noise in our Github Issues stream by first having a conversation in one of the following [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) Rooms:

- User Issues can be raised in our [User Issues Room](https://gitter.im/sdkman/user-issues).
- New Features or Enhancements can be discussed in our [CLI Development Room](https://gitter.im/sdkman/cli-dev).

After accepting a new feature or confirming that a bug was found, an Issue may be raised filling in the provided Issue Template on the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/new).

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are _always_ very welcome, but require the initial discussion on Gitter followed by a Github Issue as described above. The PR template is to be filled in before submission, ensuring that it is _linked back_ to the Github Issue number by replacing `#XXX` with the appropriate Issue reference.

Each PR should also be accompanied by a passing test(s) proving it's validity (where feasible). The feasibility of the test will emerge in the initial discussions on Gitter and in the Github Issue.
